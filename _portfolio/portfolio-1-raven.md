RAVEN stands for a Reconfigurable Architecture for Varying Emerging Neural Networks. With the evolvement of neural network models, existing solutions lack the support for more complicated dataflow and operations, including reduction operation, sparse operation and nonlinear functions, etc. Properly leveraging the reconfigurability of the hardware, we are able to address those challenges while not introducing programming overhead.

RAVEN was on the final list of Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship in 2019. [[link](https://www.qualcomm.com/invention/research/university-relations/innovation-fellowship/finalists)]

Currently, RAVEN is still in progress, and there are some related publications as listed below. Feel free to contact me if you are interested.
